This is a scratch repo for updating
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) ports that I maintain or
contribute to.

To use:

1. Clone to e.g. `~/MacPorts`
2. Run `portindex` in the top of the working tree
3. Edit `/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf` and add the location of
the working tree, e.g. `file:///Users/<username>/MacPorts`, *above*
the default source
